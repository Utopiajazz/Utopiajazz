ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ephraim Bosango,

I thrive on projects that challenge my imagination and push my mindset beyond the boundaries of rational thinking. With a passion for game development, I create experiences that spark curiosity and engagement.

ðŸŽ® Check out my latest game: [Enigmatic on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EnigmaticStudio.Enigmatic&pcampaignid=web_share)

ðŸŒ± I' currently learning:
    Data Analysis with Python: Exploring tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to uncover insights from data.
    Software Development: Building a strong foundation in Java and C++ to create efficient, scalable, and robust applications.

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to expand my skill set and apply my knowledge to real-world projects.
    With that in mind, I would be honored to work on any project that requires me to engage with game development, AI, data analysis, or software development.
    My goal is to contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow professionally and learn from each experience.
  
âš¡ Fun fact: I am fluent in French!
